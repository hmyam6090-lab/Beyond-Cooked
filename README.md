# Beyond-Cooked

Beyond Cooked is a chaotic co-op cooking game in space and different planets. Players must prepare dishes under extreme conditions: zero gravity, possessed appliances, and rogue ingredients that fight back. Success requires communication (hopefully proximity chat). Players land on a different planet each level, their rocket is their kitchen and they need to venture out (similar to lethal company) to gather ingredients or tools and cook it in their rocket to satisfy their galactic customers.
